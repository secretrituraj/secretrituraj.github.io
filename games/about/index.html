            <h1>Valentine's Day</h1>
            <p>
                As you can probably see - I've tried to make our own little version of the NYT Games (and TimeGuesser - because I don't have it in me to code Strands)
            </p>
            <p>
                I started making this December 10th - when we first mentioned not spending any money on Valentines Day - and I genuinely think I've spent more time on this than both my theses (thetheth if you had a lisp) which is slightly worrying
            </p>
            <p>
                There's the 4 games and then there's the letter - the letter's got a super hard to crack password (it's just the day we first kissed) - but don't read the letter yet
            </p>
            <p>
                There'll be a week's worth of new puzzles - so do actually check the website for the next week I'd like you to see them
            </p>
            <p>
                Also come back to this page quite often today - you'll see what we're going to do for the rest of the day
            </p>

                <h2>Hungry</h2>
                <p>I think you must be hungry now - so I've booked a reservation for lunch somewhere. I also realise that maybe this websit thing is actually not as useful as I thought for the surprise </p>

                <h2>Evening travel</h2>
                <p>I'm sure you can guess we're going somewhere - based on the fact that I'm probably lugging a suitcase around.  </p>
